# Project Submission Document

## Overview

This Trial Day assignment was designed to be completed in 4‚Äì6 hours but allocated 7 days. I invested 8 days (with around 4 days of effective effort) to go beyond expectations by implementing robust architecture, automation, and realistic data flows. Every single task and bonus point (except TS conversion) is covered.

---

## Features
All tasks outlined in the README (Tasks 1‚Äì6) are fully implemented:
- REST API adhering to best practices (proper HTTP methods, status codes, and JSON responses).
- Sequelize ORM with migration and seeder support.
- Multi-environment Docker Compose configuration supporting `.env.dev`, `.env.test`, `.env.prod`.
- Automated MySQL initialization with SQL scripts.
- Comprehensive bash scripts for managing Docker containers and project lifecycle.
- Swagger UI integration for interactive API documentation at `localhost:5555`.
- Modular and scalable project structure.

üåü Bonus Work (That Sets It Apart)
	1.	Realistic, Meaningful Sample Data
	‚Ä¢	Seeders reflect real workflows and complex relationships.
	‚Ä¢	Enables testing real transaction flows with a natural data feel.
	2.	Unified Automation Scripts
	‚Ä¢	Orchestrated with bash and Makefile.
	3.	Restructured Project for Maintainability
	‚Ä¢	Modularized Koa middleware, services, and controllers.
	‚Ä¢	Clear separation of logic, routing, and business rules.
	4.	Testing Suite
	‚Ä¢	Jest tests added to ensure API behavior under changes.
	‚Ä¢	npm run test wired for Docker-based test DB.
	5.	Improved Developer Experience
	‚Ä¢	Clear logs, concise error messages.

Note: TypeScript conversion was planned but postponed due to time constraints.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Time Investment Justification

Although the project could be ‚Äúfinished‚Äù in a day, building resilient and realistic systems takes more effort. The time was used to:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure long-term maintainability.
	‚Ä¢	Improve data realism and testability.
	‚Ä¢	Optimize scripts for developer operations (DevOps-oriented thinking).

Missed: TypeScript migration (due to focus on stability and enhancements).
Gained: Strong project structure, production-readiness, robust automation.

## Environment Configuration

The project uses environment-specific `.env` files:

- `.env.dev` ‚Äî for local development
- `.env.test` ‚Äî for integration and automated testing
- `.env.prod` ‚Äî for production deployment

Each file contains database credentials, ports, and service-specific configuration.


## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Enter project root and checkout the solution branch:

```bash
git checkout solution/masud-zaman
```

### 2. Environment Installation
Run the setup script:

```bash
chmod +x ./cmd/* && ./cmd/install
```

### 3. Then Visit the Swagger UI at: http://localhost:5555

## API Documentation: API Test Form
Swagger UI is available at:
URL: [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)

It provides interactive documentation and allows you to test all endpoints.

**Web URLs:**

- API Base URL: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- PhpMyAdmin: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
- Database: `issue_db`
- Username: `root`
- Password: `abc123456`

# Credentials
	‚Ä¢	Default Admin: admin@example.com / Password123
	‚Ä¢	MySQL credentials: configured via .env or Docker


This `install` script will create a `.env` file with default values and set up the necessary Docker containers.
The installation script will fully automate the setup process, including the configuration of all Docker services, installation of necessary dependencies and specific configurations, database initialization, and seeding of initial data. With this single-step operation, everything will be up and running in just a few minutes. In most cases, you won‚Äôt need to manually verify or test any of the setup steps unless there are special circumstances that require attention.

And this is the simple installation process ‚Äî setting everything up effortlessly, so you can get started in no time!

## Docker Shortcut Scripts

| Script     | Description                          | Example Usage                       |
|------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `up`       | Starts Docker containers             | `./cmd/up`                              |
| `stop`     | Stops Docker containers              | `./cmd/stop`                            |
| `down`     | Stops and removes containers         | `./cmd/down`                            |
| `restart`  | Restarts containers                  | `./cmd/restart`                         |
| `rebuild`  | Rebuilds containers with no cache    | `./cmd/rebuild`                         |
| `reinstall`| Reinstall containers with fresh database | `./cmd/reinstall`                         |

Make them executable:

```bash
chmod +x cmd/*
```

## Managing the Project

Installation & Setup

Run the install script to build Docker images, start containers, wait for DB readiness, run migrations, and seed initial data:

`./cmd/install dev` or, simply `./cmd/install`

For test or prod:

./cmd/install test
./cmd/install prod


Entering app container:
```
./cmd/app
```

‚∏ª

Reinstallation (Full Reset)

Completely clean volumes, rebuild, migrate, and seed:

./cmd/reinstall dev


‚∏ª

Container Lifecycle
	‚Ä¢	Start containers (if stopped):

./cmd/start dev


	‚Ä¢	Stop containers:

./cmd/stop dev


	‚Ä¢	Restart containers:

./cmd/restart dev


	‚Ä¢	Rebuild containers (clean build):

./cmd/rebuild dev


	‚Ä¢	Execute shell inside app container:

./cmd/exec dev



‚∏ª

Database Management
	‚Ä¢	MySQL container uses the SQL scripts in docker-entrypoint-initdb.d to initialize the database schema on first container startup.
	‚Ä¢	Sequelize migrations keep schema up to date.
	‚Ä¢	Seeders provide initial and sample data for testing.
	‚Ä¢	Migration and seed commands are triggered automatically during install and reinstall.
	‚Ä¢	Manual migration commands available:

docker exec -it $(docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps -q app) npm run migrate
docker exec -it $(docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps -q app) npm run seed
Or, 
./cmd/app
npm run migrate
npm run seed


Testing
For test run, please
```
./cmd/app
npm run test
```

Or,
```bash
./cmd/test
```

`./cmd/test` command will generate complete logs for the test cases.

‚∏ª

Development Tips
	‚Ä¢	Use the cmd/env script to switch environment variables quickly.
	‚Ä¢	Edit .env.* files carefully to match your environment.
	‚Ä¢	Use Docker Compose override files if extending the stack.
	‚Ä¢	Run migration rollback commands if needed:
./cmd/app
npm run db:migrate:undo
npm run db:migrate:undo:all

## User Authentication & Authorization

### Overview

- Introduced user management with `users` table storing email and hashed password.
- Added login API (`POST /login`) accepting email and password, returning JWT token and expiry.
- Configurable JWT secret and expiry time via environment variables (`JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`).
- Middleware enforces valid JWT for all protected routes except `/`, `/health`, and `/login`.
- Every request must include a valid `X-Client-ID` header matched against `VALID_CLIENT_ID` env variable (my-client-id-123).
- The email from the validated JWT is recorded as the author (`created_by` / `updated_by`) on issue changes.

### Usage

- Register users by seeding or direct DB insert with bcrypt hashed passwords.
- Obtain JWT token by calling `/login` with JSON body:

  ```json
  {
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "Password123"
  }```

  	‚Ä¢	Use the token in Authorization: Bearer <token> header for all protected API calls.
	‚Ä¢	Always include the valid X-Client-ID header on requests.
	‚Ä¢	Token expires based on JWT_EXPIRES_IN environment setting.


## Postman Collection

To use the Postman collection, follow these steps:

1. Import the **`./Trail Day REST API.postman_collection.json`** file into Postman.
2. After logging in or registering, save the **Bearer Token** in the `Authorization` section. You can use this token for subsequent requests.

üìå Final Note

This submission reflects deep commitment to quality and realistic engineering. I didn‚Äôt just finish the task ‚Äî I built a system you can scale, extend, and maintain with confidence.
