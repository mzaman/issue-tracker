## Architecture Overview

The solution implements a modular Node.js/Koa.js REST API with the following components:

- **API Layer:** Koa.js with structured routing and middleware
- **Database:** MySQL with Sequelize ORM, migrations, and seeders
- **Authentication:** JWT-based with role management
- **Documentation:** Swagger UI integration
- **Testing:** Jest test suite with Docker-based test database
- **DevOps:** Multi-environment Docker Compose with automation scripts

---

## Core Features Implementation

### âœ… Required Tasks (All Completed)

- **Task 1-6:** REST API with proper HTTP methods, status codes, and JSON responses
- **Database Integration:** Sequelize ORM with migration and seeder support
- **Multi-Environment Support:** Docker Compose configuration for dev/test/prod
- **Database Initialization:** Automated MySQL setup with SQL scripts
- **Process Automation:** Comprehensive bash scripts for container management
- **API Documentation:** Interactive Swagger UI at `localhost:5555`

### ðŸ”§ Additional Engineering Enhancements

**Realistic Data Modeling**
- Comprehensive seed data reflecting real-world usage patterns
- Complex relationships enabling realistic transaction flows
- Meaningful sample data for effective testing

**Operational Excellence**
- Unified automation via bash scripts and Makefile
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Docker-based development workflow with hot reload

**Code Quality & Maintainability**
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Structured middleware, services, and controllers
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Testing Infrastructure**
- Jest test suite covering API endpoints
- Docker-based test database isolation
- Automated test execution via `./cmd/app` + `npm run test` or `./cmd/test`

---

## Engineering Approach

Rather than implementing a minimal solution, I focused on building a system that demonstrates real-world engineering practices. This included investing time in automation, realistic data modeling, comprehensive testing, and operational tooling that would be expected in a production environment.

**Trade-off Decision:** TypeScript migration was planned but deferred in favor of ensuring robust core functionality, comprehensive testing, and operational reliability. The current JavaScript implementation prioritizes stability and thorough feature coverage.

---

## Environment Configuration

The project supports multiple environments with dedicated configuration:

- `.env.dev` â€” Local development environment
- `.env.test` â€” Testing and CI environment
- `.env.prod` â€” Production deployment

Each environment maintains isolated database credentials, ports, and service configurations.

## Container Management

### Quick Commands

| Script        | Purpose                                 | Usage              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `install`     | Complete setup with seeding            | `./cmd/install`    |
| `up`          | Start containers                        | `./cmd/up`         |
| `stop`        | Stop containers                         | `./cmd/stop`       |
| `down`        | Stop and remove containers              | `./cmd/down`       |
| `restart`     | Restart all services                    | `./cmd/restart`    |
| `rebuild`     | Rebuild with no cache                   | `./cmd/rebuild`    |
| `reinstall`   | Fresh installation with clean database  | `./cmd/reinstall`  |

### Environment-Specific Operations

```bash
# Install for specific environment
./cmd/install dev    # Default if no environment specified
./cmd/install test   # Testing environment with isolated database
./cmd/install prod   # Production-ready configuration

# Environment switching
./cmd/env dev        # Switch to development environment
./cmd/env test       # Switch to testing environment

# Complete reinstallation with fresh database
./cmd/reinstall dev  # Clean volumes, rebuild, migrate, and seed
```

---

## Database Management

### Automated Setup

- SQL initialization scripts in `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`
- Sequelize migrations for schema versioning
- Comprehensive seeders with realistic sample data

### Manual Operations

```bash
./cmd/app
npm run migrate
npm run seed
npm run migrate:undo
npm run migrate:undo:all
```

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### Implementation

- User management with secure password hashing
- JWT token-based authentication via `POST /login`
- Required `X-Client-ID` header validation
- Automatic audit trail with `created_by`/`updated_by` tracking

### Usage Example

```bash
# Login
POST /login
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "Password123"
}

# Use token for authenticated requests
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
X-Client-ID: my-client-id-123
```

**Token Features:**
- Configurable expiry via `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` environment variable
- Email claims automatically recorded as `created_by`/`updated_by` in audit trails
- Secure JWT secret configuration via `JWT_SECRET`

---

## Testing

### Test Execution

```bash
./cmd/test
# or
./cmd/app
npm run test
```

### Test Coverage

- API endpoint validation
- Authentication flow testing
- Database integration tests
- Error handling verification

---

## API Documentation

**Interactive Documentation:** Available at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) via Swagger UI with complete endpoint testing capabilities.

**Postman Collection:** Import `Trail Day REST API.postman_collection.json` for automated testing workflows:
1. Import the collection into Postman
2. Authenticate via `/login` endpoint 
3. Token automatically applied to subsequent requests
4. Complete test coverage for all endpoints

---

## Development Workflow

### Container Access

```bash
./cmd/app  # Enter application container
./cmd/exec dev  # Execute shell in dev environment
```

### Database Access

- **PhpMyAdmin:** [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
- **Direct MySQL:** Connect to `localhost:3306` with provided credentials

### Log Monitoring

```bash
docker-compose logs -f app
docker-compose logs -f mysql
```

## Summary

This submission delivers a complete, production-ready REST API that exceeds the basic requirements through thoughtful engineering practices. The solution emphasizes maintainability, operational reliability, and realistic data flows while providing comprehensive tooling for development and deployment workflows.
