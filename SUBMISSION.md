## Engineering Approach

Rather than implementing a minimal solution, I focused on building a system that demonstrates real-world engineering practices. This included investing time in automation, realistic data modeling, comprehensive testing, and operational tooling that would be expected in a production environment.

**Trade-off Decision:** TypeScript migration was planned but deferred in favor of ensuring robust core functionality, comprehensive testing, and operational reliability. The current JavaScript implementation prioritizes stability and thorough feature coverage.

---

## Environment Configuration

The project supports multiple environments with dedicated configuration:

- `.env.dev` â€” Local development environment
- `.env.test` â€” Testing and CI environment
- `.env.prod` â€” Production deployment

Each environment maintains isolated database credentials, ports, and service configurations.

## Container Management

### Quick Commands

| Script        | Purpose                                 | Usage              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `install`     | Complete setup with seeding            | `./cmd/install`    |
| `up`          | Start containers                        | `./cmd/up`         |
| `stop`        | Stop containers                         | `./cmd/stop`       |
| `down`        | Stop and remove containers              | `./cmd/down`       |
| `restart`     | Restart all services                    | `./cmd/restart`    |
| `rebuild`     | Rebuild with no cache                   | `./cmd/rebuild`    |
| `reinstall`   | Fresh installation with clean database  | `./cmd/reinstall`  |

### Environment-Specific Operations

```bash
# Install for specific environment
./cmd/install dev    # Default if no environment specified
./cmd/install test   # Testing environment with isolated database
./cmd/install prod   # Production-ready configuration

# Environment switching
./cmd/env dev        # Switch to development environment
./cmd/env test       # Switch to testing environment

# Complete reinstallation with fresh database
./cmd/reinstall dev  # Clean volumes, rebuild, migrate, and seed
```

---

## Database Management

### Automated Setup

- SQL initialization scripts in `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` is available, but not used due to automatic database initialization setup using docker-compose, customized scripts, and environment variables for migrations and seeds.
- Sequelize migrations for schema versioning
- Comprehensive seeders with realistic sample data

### Manual Operations

```bash
./cmd/app
npm run migrate
npm run seed
npm run migrate:undo
npm run migrate:undo:all
```

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### Implementation

- User management with secure password hashing
- JWT token-based authentication via `POST /login`
- Required `X-Client-ID` header validation
- Automatic audit trail with `created_by`/`updated_by` tracking

### Usage Example

```bash
# Login
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-client-id: my-client-id-123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "email": "user-1@example.com",
  "password": "Password123"
}'
```

# Use token for authenticated requests
Headers:
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
X-Client-ID: my-client-id-123
```

**Token Features:**
- Configurable expiry via `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` environment variable
- Email claims automatically recorded as `created_by`/`updated_by` in audit trails
- Secure JWT secret configuration via `JWT_SECRET`

---

## Testing

### Test Execution

```bash
./cmd/test
# or
./cmd/app
npm run test
```

### Test Coverage

- API endpoint validation
- Authentication flow testing
- Database integration tests
- Error handling verification

## API Documentation

**Interactive Documentation:** Available at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) via Swagger UI with complete endpoint testing capabilities. 
**YAML Documentation:** Full endpoint documentation available at `./swagger.yaml` for offline reference and integration testing. 

This API allows clients to perform discovery, health checks, and issue tracking.
This API requires:
- Setting the `X-Client-ID` header for all requests. Set this value: `my-client-id-123` to X-Client-ID field in Authorize area.
- Authorizing using Bearer Token after login. Set token via Authorization tab or `Authorization` header.

## API Endpoints Summary
- `POST /login` - User authentication
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/[resource]` - CRUD operations
- `GET /api/v2/[resource]` - Versioned endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/discovery` - Discovery endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/issues` - Issue tracking endpoint

## Versioning and Prefix
- You can switch between versions using the path parameters like `/v1`, `/v2`, or omit when not needed.
- Prefix can also be changed dynamically depending on environment setup.
- For example, `/api/v1` or `/api/v2` or `/v1` or `/v2` depending on the setup. And all APIs are accessible in all combinations of: 
	- `No prefix (/)` `Version only (/v1, /v2, etc.)` `API prefix only (/api)` `API prefix + version (/api/v1, /api/v2, etc.)`

- When version grows (v1, v2, and so on), as a future-proof solution, this setup allows:
	-	`/health` `/api/health` `/v1/health` `/v2/health` `/api/v1/health` `/api/v2/health` etc...
	
* All endpoints require `X-Client-ID` (Value: `my-client-id-123`).  
* Some endpoints require Bearer Token from login response.

## Postman Collection

**Postman Collection:** Import `Trail Day REST API.postman_collection.json` for automated testing workflows:
1. Import the collection into Postman
2. Authenticate via `/login` endpoint 
3. Token automatically applied to subsequent requests
4. Complete test coverage for all endpoints

---

## Production Deployment Notes
- Use `./cmd/install prod` for production setup
- Ensure environment variables are properly configured
- Database credentials should be updated for production
- Consider load balancing and scaling requirements

---


## Troubleshooting
- **Port conflicts:** Ensure ports 8080, 5555, 8081, 3306 are available
- **Docker issues:** Run `docker system prune` if containers fail to start
- **Database connection errors:** Verify MySQL container is fully initialized

## Development Workflow
### Container Access

```bash
./cmd/app  # Enter application container
./cmd/exec dev  # Execute shell in dev environment
```

### Database Access

- **PhpMyAdmin:** [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
- **Direct MySQL:** Connect to `localhost:3306` with provided credentials

### Log Monitoring

```bash
docker-compose logs -f app
docker-compose logs -f mysql
```

---

## Future Enhancements
- TypeScript migration for better type safety
- Redis caching layer implementation
- API rate limiting
- Enhanced monitoring and logging
